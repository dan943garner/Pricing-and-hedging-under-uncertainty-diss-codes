# Pricing-and-hedging-under-uncertainty-diss-codes
The problem of pricing and hedging under parameter uncertainty can be a complicated process with many different approaches available. This research project will look specifically at pricing and hedging under parameter uncertainty for a class of Markov processes that include some special cases such as the Black-Scholes market model and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. We will lay the foundations for these classes of Markov processes, known as generalized affine processes. We will then discuss the types of uncertainty that such a process can posses before focusing on the notion of parameter uncertainty and investigating the effect that parameter uncertainty has on these generalized affine processes. We aim to propose a deep hedging approach that will effectively solve this stated problem. Finally, we will consider our found approach on simulated data and then real life scenarios in order to compare the effectiveness of robust deep hedging with already existing hedging approaches during periods where high uncertainty is present.
